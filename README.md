The Tribe 10U Walkout Songs Page
Welcome to the heart of the diamond—where young talent shines!

Congratulations to all the parents whose children have made the Tribe 10U team! We’re so excited to have your little slugger on board and can’t wait to see them step up to the plate. To make their moment at bat even more special, we invite you to join our Tribe family in selecting their walkout songs. Share two songs you’d love to hear as your child strides to the batter’s box—include the song titles and artists (e.g., "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses and "Uptown Funk" by Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars). Let’s fill the field with energy, pride, and the perfect beat to get the crowd cheering!

Together, we’ll create unforgettable memories for our young stars on the baseball field!
